Pinboard Tag Nuker
=================

Pinboard Tag Nuker exists because I was bored one night, and decided I wanted to startover on tags for my pinboard account, but without doing it manually, or losing any bookmarks.

The Pinboard API happens to have an endpoint to list tags, and one to delete them. This script is just nice glue for wiring those two calls together.

INSTALL:
--------

1. Download code
2. Code -> Your Server
3. Edit pinboard.php to add in your username and password
4. Run the code from the command line:
	$ php5 pinboard.php
5. ????
6. Profit
